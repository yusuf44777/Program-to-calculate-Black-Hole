# Program-to-calculate-Black-Hole
I created a function that takes the name and the mass (in solar masses) of a black hole as an argument and returns the Schwarzschild radius, the Schwarzschild density and the type of black hole.

A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing⁠ — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light ⁠— can escape from it.

The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes historically referred to as the gravitational radius) is a physical parameter that shows up in the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equations, corresponding to the radius defining the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.
